# III OGA Chair Group - CHALLENGE

**Challenge 1. Representation, processing and visualization of multidimensional datasets:**
- Tasks:
    - Representation, processing and visualization of multidimensional datasets
    - Choose an appropriate graphic (originality and effectiveness): heat maps, linear, map, vertical bars, pie, etc.
    - Focus attention on what we are interested in: size, colors, position, etc.
- Limitations:
    - Resources that can be used: free
- Datasets and useful links:
    - [Global Debt Database](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/datasets/GDD)
    - [ipcc](https://www.ipcc.ch/languages-2/spanish/)

- Final results:
    - Dashboard made with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)

**Challenge 2. Sign Language Detection:**
- Tasks:
    - Recognize, using a ML/DL model, sign language in pictures or video.
- Limitations:
    - Resources that can be used: free

- Final results:
    - Pretrained model from [SignLanguageRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SignLanguageRecognition/) library with realtime detection adapted to detect the sign language from pictures using [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) library.

**Total challenge time: 3 hours**

[!NOTE]
All executions are performed with [Python 3.10.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
